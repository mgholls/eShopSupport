# eShopSupport 

A sample .NET application showcasing common use cases and development practices for build AI solutions in .NET (Generative AI, specifically). This sample demonstrates a customer support application for an e-commerce website using a services-based architecture with .NET Aspire. It includes support for the following AI use cases:

* Text classification, applying labels based on content
* Sentiment analysis based on message content
* Summarization of large sets of text
* Synthetic data generation, creating test content for the sample
* Chat bot interactions with chat history and suggested responses

This sample also demonstrates the following development practices:

* Developing a solution locally, using small local models
* Evaluating the quality of AI responses using grounded Q&A data
* Leveraging Python projects as part of a .NET Aspire solution
* Deploying the application, including small local models, to the Cloud (coming soon)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A device with an Nvidia GPU (see [workaround for running on the CPU](https://github.com/dotnet/eShopSupport/issues/19))
- Clone the eShopSupport repository: https://github.com/dotnet/eshopsupport
- [Install & start Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Python 3.12.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3125/)

#### Windows with Visual Studio
- Install [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.10 or newer](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
  - Select the following workloads:
    - `ASP.NET and web development` workload.
    - `Python Development` workload.
    - `.NET Aspire SDK` component in `Individual components`.

#### Mac, Linux, & Windows without Visual Studio
- Install the latest [.NET 8 SDK](https://dot.net/download?cid=eshop)
- Install the [.NET Aspire workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling?tabs=dotnet-cli%2Cunix#install-net-aspire) with the following commands:

  ```powershell
  dotnet workload update
  dotnet workload install aspire
  dotnet restore eShopSupport.sln
  ```
- (Optionally) Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with the [C# Dev Kit extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)

#### Install Python requirements

From the Terminal, at the root of the cloned repo, run:

```powershell
# Using poetry to create a virtual environment. Did not record commands to set up.
poetry env activate
pip install -r src/PythonInference/requirements.txt
```

**Note:** If the above command doesn't work on Windows, use the following command:

```powershell
py -m pip install -r src/PythonInference/requirements.txt
```

### Running the solution

> [!WARNING]
> Remember to ensure that Docker is started.

* (Windows only) Run the application from Visual Studio:
  - Open the `eShopSupport.sln` file in Visual Studio
  - Ensure that `AppHost` is your startup project
  - Hit Ctrl-F5 to launch .NET Aspire

* Or run the application from your terminal:

  ```powershell
  dotnet run --project src/AppHost
  ```

  then look for lines like this in the console output in order to find the URL to open the Aspire dashboard:

  ```sh
  Login to the dashboard at: http://localhost:17191/login?t=uniquelogincodeforyou
  ```

> You may need to install ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificates first, and then close all browser tabs. Learn more at https://aka.ms/aspnet/https-trust-dev-cert
